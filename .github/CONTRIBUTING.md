We are not looking for neither graphic artists nor code developers. There are other ways you can contribute to this project though.

If you can contribute with missing localizations, that would be helpful. If you happen to have an elegant fix for a bug, feel free to make a pull request, though we in now way guarantee your exact fix will be used. Though if you can bring an issue to our attention we were unaware of, that is of course helpful.

The biggest contribution is to pledge to our Patreon, and help us secure the future of this project. Or a little beer tip on PayPal, we do love those. Apart from that we would love for you to join us on Discord and any other of our communites linked below!
